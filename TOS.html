        <p class="u-small-text u-text u-text-variant u-text-white u-text-1"> The "wait time" we are referring to, is how long it takes for you to receive the pet. Some pets have higher wait times as more players want to purchase them. We recommend purchasing pets with lower wait times or paying to skip the wait times. Skipping a wait time costs 500 robux, or you can trade-in your adopt me pets. If you skip a waitlist, you will get a pet worth equal the amount you gave to skip, for example, if you skip with 750 robux, you will also recieve a neon owl. If you skip with a cow in adopt me, you will recieve a owl after the waitlist period of that is over (it will be shortened by half the time).&nbsp;If you have more questions, feel free to ask us.<br>
